# AI Facts

**Note:** LLMs can sometimes provide incorrect or outdated information. Always verify critical information through trusted sources.

This project is a Next.js application that performs real-time fact checking on spoken statements. It uses Deepgram for audio transcription and leverages both Undrstnd to verify the accuracy of claims.

## Features

- Real-time Audio Transcription: Captures and transcribes spoken audio using Deepgram's API
- AI Fact Checking: Uses Undrstnd to cross-reference and verify statements
- Live Results: Shows fact-checking results in real-time as statements are processed
- Explanation of Validity: Provides detailed explanations for why statements are considered true or false

## Technology Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend and API routes
- [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) for interacting with LLMs
- [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) for audio transcription
- [Undrstnd](https://dev.undrstnd-labs.com/) for validating claims
- [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## How It Works

1. Speak into microphone
2. Deepgram processes the audio stream in real-time and returns transcribed text
3. The transcribed text is analyzed for distinct statements ('?!.')
4. Each statement is sent to Undrstnd for fact checking
5. The verification status and explanation are displayed to the user

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

   ```
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   UNDRSTND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your project should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
